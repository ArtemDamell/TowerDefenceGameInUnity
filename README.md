# Tower Defence Game In Unity
## This game was created by me during one of the university courses in 2020.

Unfortunately, there was not enough time to finish it, but the main mechanics are implemented and working.

Looking at this code now, I realize how poorly it was written, but I won't refactor it so that in the future I can see progress in my programming skills on the Unity game engine.
